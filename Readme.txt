1) The Functionality Of Task1:
>>The program asks the user to enter an integer.

>>It then checks:

>>If the number is divisible by 2 (using the % modulus operator),

>>If yes, it prints that the number is even.

>>If no, it prints that the number is odd.

>>It uses an if-else control structure to decide and display the result


2) The Funtionality Of task2:

>>Goal: Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50.

>>Steps:

>>Use a for loop to go through every number from 1 to 50.

>>Add each number to a running total (a variable).

>>Print the final sum after the loop finishes.
